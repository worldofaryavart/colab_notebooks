However, a scalable way of implementing electromagnetism has been lacking — until now. Alicia J. Kollár News & Views31 Oct 2024 Nature Physics P: 1-2 Data needs and challenges for quantum dot devices automation Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system for realizing scalable, coupled qubit systems and serving as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization, tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable autonomous tuning approaches are developed. This meeting report outlines current challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also present insights and ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them. We aim to provide guidance and inspiration to researchers invested in automation efforts.

Advertisement COMMENT 22 October 2024 Consider the ethical impacts of quantum technologies in defence — before it’s too late Quantum technologies can help to defend nations, but they also threaten human rights and values. Their design and development need ethical guidance now.

For instance, quantum sensors — which use quantum behaviours to measure forces and radiation — can detect objects with precision and sensitivity, even underground or underwater. Quantum communications systems that are resistant to jamming can revolutionize command and control.Interest is growing globally. For example, in 2023, the US Department of Defense announced a US$45-million project to integrate quantum components into weapons systems to increase the precision of targeting. The nation also tested a quantum receiver for long-range radio communications. The UK Ministry of Defence (which funds some of our research) is investing in quantum sensors and clocks. Earlier this year, it tested a quantum-based navigation system that cannot be jammed. India’s Ministry of Defence is investing in the use of quantum ‘keys’ to encrypt sensitive military data. China is also developing quantum capabilities for defence, including a quantum radar system that can overcome ‘stealth’ technology, which is designed to make aeroplanes or ships, for example, hard to detect using conventional radar.However, as well as promises, these uses come with ethical risks1,2 (see ‘Key risks of using quantum technologies in defence’). For example, powerful quantum computers could enable the creation of new molecules and forms of chemical or biological weapons. They might break cryptographic measures that underpin secure online communications, with catastrophic consequences for digitally based societies. Quantum sensors could be used to enhance surveillance, breaching rights to privacy, anonymity and freedom of communication. Quantum algorithms can be difficult to reverse-engineer, which might make it difficult to ascribe responsibility for their outcomes (a ‘responsibility gap’).Key risks of using quantum technologies in defenceTypeRiskExampleKnown knownsPrivacyQuantum computers could break encryption standards, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data.Known knownsSecurityBreaking of encryption standards could reveal government secrets, with national security implications.Known knownsOversightQuantum algorithms could be difficult to reverse-engineer, hindering transparency and auditing.Known knownsSustainabilityEnergy-intensive computing will have a negative impact on the environment.Known unknownsJust warThe synthesis of new molecules might create chemical or biological weaponry that could breach just-war requirements.Known unknownsCompound risksQuantum tools will exist in an ecosystem with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, compounding the risk', 'summary': 'Quantum technologies hold great promise for aiding national defence.

In 1968, IBM – a company that now covers its logo in a rainbow flag each June for Pride Month – fired Conway when she expressed her intention to transition. She died on June 9, 2024 at age 86. IBM eventually apologized to the now-famous computing expert, but only 52 years later, when Conway was 82 years old.Although Conway’s start as a trans woman while at IBM was inauspicious, she quickly found a new job under her post-transition name and identity at the prestigious Xerox PARC and for many years kept the fact that she was trans from her employers to avoid being unfairly dismissed again. In so doing, Conway escaped becoming a target of the sensationalistic and harmful news coverage about trans people that dominated mainstream media in the 20th century. At the same time, however, this meant she was also not able to fully tell her story.Even today, mainstream media coverage of trans people often positions them as unfortunate victims or questions trans people’s right to exist at all.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Conway’s co-invention of very large-scale integration, or VLSI, rocketed chip design into the future. VLSI allowed etching circuits on a computer chip’s surface to be as space efficient as possible, ensuring the maximum number of transistors on a chip.Maximizing the number of transistors on a chip meant that the resulting computer using that chip could be as fast and powerful as possible. For this innovation, Conway received industry and academic recognition. However, that recognition was long delayed.The ‘Conway Effect’Like many other women in computing, however, Conway felt that she had been denied her due credit because of the way that her male co-inventor of VLSI, Carver Mead, was repeatedly given more credit and incorrectly perceived as the lead on the project that led to this important innovation. Although Mead did not necessarily seek to unfairly take credit for himself, what Conway dubbed the Conway Effect led to him getting more, or sometimes all, of the credit.The Conway Effect is a slightly modified version of what is known as the Mathilda Effect: Women’s scientific contributions are often attributed to the nearest man working on the same topic. The Conway Effect states that people who are “othered” in computing, including women and people of color of all genders, form a group that society does not expect to make great advances, and so they are not given full credit when they do because they are literally overlooked.Conway pointed out that, after some initial recognition together, Mead was given sole awards for their joint work, as well as being celebrated along with other men at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley. She and other women who had done the same work, even when they were in leadership positions, were not invited or similarly recognized.Conway wrote about her experience in the essay where she introduced the “Conway Effect.”In 2009, my disappearance was complete after the Computer History Museum’s gala celebration of the 50th anniversary of the integrated circuit. Sixteen men were described by the media as “the Valley’s founding fathers.” They were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for their contributions to microelectronics. Top billing went to Gordon Moore and Carver Mead. I was not invited to the event, and didn’t even know it was happening.Conway was added to the Computer History Museum in 2014, 12 years after Mead. Even how the computing field refers to their innovation as the “Mead-Conway method,” with Mead’s name first despite not being first alphabetically, shows this unfortunate effect.Out and into a new roleConway worked and lived quietly for much of her career, making important strides that reshaped the field of computing while trying not to out herself as a trans woman working in a conservative industry. Later in her life, she realized that the low profile she had sought to keep would be untenable if her career were to make it into the history books, which it even\", 'summary': 'Lynn Conway, a transgender computer scientist, was known for her work in designing computer chips.

FinalSparkComputingArtificial intelligence systems, even those as sophisticated as ChatGPT, depend on the same silicon-based hardware that has been the bedrock of computing since the 1950s. But what if computers could be molded from living biological matter? Some researchers in academia and the commercial sector, wary of AI’s ballooning demands for data storage and energy, are focusing on a growing field known as biocomputing. This approach uses synthetic biology, such as miniature clusters of lab-grown cells called organoids, to create computer architecture. Biocomputing pioneers include Swiss company FinalSpark, which earlier this year debuted its “Neuroplatform”—a computer platform powered by human-brain organoids—that scientists can rent over the Internet for $500 a month.“As far as I know, we are the only ones in the world doing this” on a publicly rentable platform, says FinalSpark co-founder Fred Jordan. Initially bankrolled with funds from its co-founders’ previous start-up, FinalSpark seeks an environmentally sustainable way to support AI. “Our principal goal is artificial intelligence for 100,000 times less energy” than what’s currently required to train state-of-the-art generative AI, Jordan says. Neuroplatform uses a series of processing units hosting four spherical brain organoids each. Every 0.5-millimeter-wide organoid is connected to eight electrodes that electrically stimulate the neurons within the living sphere; those electrodes also link the organoids to conventional computer networks. The neurons are selectively exposed to the feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine to mimic the human brain’s natural reward system. These twin setups—positive dopamine rewards and electrical stimulation—train the organoids’ neurons, prompting them to form new pathways and connections much in the same way a living human brain appears to learn. If perfected, this training could eventually allow organoids to mimic silicon-based AI and serve as processing units with functions similar to today’s CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units), FinalSpark says.For now, the organoids and their behavior are live streamed 24 hours a day for researchers (and anyone else) to observe. “The challenge is to find the appropriate way to get neurons to do what we want them to do,” Jordan says.Rights & PermissionsJordan Kinard is a freelance writer in New York City.
